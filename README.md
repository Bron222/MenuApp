OVERVIEW OF SYSTEM

![MenuAppPic](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e20bb6d8-e3f7-48c9-9853-8aa76d487a18)

This project is a simple GUI app implemented with the capability to take multiple orders from a menu, add them to a grand total, calculate tax, and create a detailed receipt via .txt file within the current directory.

INSTRUCTIONS ON USE
===================

Upon opening the program, follow the on-screen instructions and select the "Add an order" button. Alternatively, select the "Quit" button to end the program at any time.
If adding an order, a menu will open with check boxes for the user to choose any item they wish to order. After making selections, click "Add to order" to return to the main screen with the subtotal calculated.
At this point, the user may add another order or sumbit the order with the "Submit Order" button. There is no constraint on the amount of orders that may be added to one transaction. Each subsequent order will be add to the grand total.
After sumbitting the order, a reciept.txt file will be generated in the same directory and a notification will prompt the user that their order was sumbitted.


SPECIAL NOTES
=============

Menu items, prices, and tax amount are constants that can be changed easily within the code as needed.
